How Memory Is Divided into Locations at Runtime

-  The division of memory into specific memory locations of fixed sizes is done at the hardware and software level.
-  The memory is physically organized and divided into individual bytes, and each byte has a unique address. This division is a fundamental aspect of computer architecture.
-  When you declare variables or allocate memory for data structures in your code, the compiler or runtime environment handles the allocation of memory for you.
-  The size of each memory location is determined by the data type of the variable or data structure you are working with.
-   For example, if you declare an int variable, the compiler will allocate 4 bytes of memory to store that integer, and it will manage the memory layout for you.
-   So, while you don't control the physical layout of memory at runtime, you do specify the data types and sizes of variables and data structures in your code, and the system takes care of allocating the appropriate amount of memory for them based on those specifications.
